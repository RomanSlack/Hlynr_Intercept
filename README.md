# Hlynr Intercept – Nuclear-Defense Path-Finding Simulator

A physically realizable Gymnasium-style environment for developing and testing reinforcement learning algorithms in missile interception scenarios. This project provides a sandbox for deterrence-focused RL research, enabling rapid prototyping and evaluation of AI decision-making systems under extreme time constraints.

## Overview

Hlynr Intercept simulates defensive missile interception scenarios where an AI agent must learn optimal trajectories to intercept incoming threats before they reach defended targets. The environment progresses from simple 2D kinematics to high-fidelity 6-DOF simulations across multiple phases, supporting research into hierarchical reinforcement learning, distributed training, and real-time decision making.

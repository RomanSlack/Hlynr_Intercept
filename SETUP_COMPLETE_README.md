source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate Aegis_11

# Run validation (takes ~30 seconds)

## What to Watch During Training

### Key Metric: `episode/success_rate_pct`

**Success Pattern** (Good!):
```
0-2M steps:   0% → 15%   (learning)
2-5M steps:  15% → 30%   (improving)
5-8M steps:  30% → 40%   (converging)
8-10M steps: 40% stable  (success!)
```

**Failure Pattern** (Bad - same as LSTM):
```
0-500k:   0% → 20%   (early peak)
500k-3M: 20% → 10%   (degrading)
3M-10M:  10% → 0%    (collapsed)
```

### Secondary Metrics

**train/value_loss**:
- Should drop: 40,000 → 5,000 → <2,000
- Red flag if stuck >7,000

**rollout/ep_rew_mean**:
- Should increase: -500 → +1,000 → +3,000 → +5,000
- Red flag if decreasing or oscillating

---

## Decision Points

### @ 2M Steps (~1.2 hours)
- **Expected**: Success 10-20%, value loss <10k
- **Abort if**: Success <5% (same pattern as LSTM)

### @ 5M Steps (~3 hours)
- **Expected**: Success 25-35%, value loss <5k
- **Abort if**: Success declining from peak

### @ 10M Steps (~6 hours)
- **Evaluate**: Run inference on best model
- **Compare**: MLP result vs 33% LSTM baseline

---

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Acceptable**:
- Success rate >30% (match LSTM)
- Stable throughout training (no collapse)
- Value loss <5,000

**Good Performance**:
- Success rate >40% (exceed LSTM)
- Stable and increasing
- Value loss <2,000

**Excellent Performance**:
- Success rate >50%
- Consistent across episodes
- Ready for curriculum progression

## If Training Fails

### MLP Also Shows Inverse Curve
→ Problem is NOT LSTM-specific
→ Check: Reward structure, curriculum, exploration
→ Next: Try SAC, privileged learning, or omniscient baseline

### MLP Gets Low Performance (<20%)
→ Partial observability too hard for MLP
→ LSTM needed but with different training approach
→ Next: Try Transformer, attention mechanism, or HER

### Training Crashes/Errors
→ Check validate_setup.py output
→ Review error logs in logs/training_TIMESTAMP/
→ Common issues: GPU OOM, environment mismatch

---

## Post-Training Analysis

After training completes:

```bash
# Run inference on best model
python inference.py \
  --model checkpoints/training_TIMESTAMP/best/best_model.zip \
  --mode offline \
  --num_episodes 100

# Check results
cat inference_results/offline_run_TIMESTAMP/summary.txt
```

**Questions to Answer**:
1. Did success rate stay stable or increase?
2. Did it exceed 30% (LSTM baseline)?
3. Did value loss converge <5,000?
4. Are outcomes bimodal or distributed?

## Key Differences from LSTM

| Feature | LSTM (Previous) | MLP (Current) | Impact |
|---------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Recurrence | Yes | No | Removes instability |
| Temporal Context | 256 hidden state | 4-frame stack | Simpler approach |
| Horizon | ~100 steps | ~333 steps | Better credit |
| Batch Size | 128 | 256 | More stable |
| Learning Rate | 1e-4 | 3e-4 | Faster learning |
| Architecture | [256,256]+LSTM | [512,512,256] | More capacity |
| Normalization | None | VecNormalize+LayerNorm | Stable training |

---

## Theoretical Justification

### Extended Horizon Math

**Effective Horizon**: $h = \frac{1}{1 - \gamma \lambda}$

- Previous: $h = \frac{1}{1 - 0.99 \times 0.95} = \frac{1}{0.0595} \approx 100$ steps
- Current: $h = \frac{1}{1 - 0.997 \times 0.97} = \frac{1}{0.033} \approx 333$ steps

**Why This Matters**: Episodes are ~1800 steps. With 100-step horizon, actions at t=500 get essentially zero credit from terminal reward at t=1800. With 333-step horizon, credit assignment reaches much farther back.

### Frame-Stacking Capability

**From 4 stacked frames**, MLP can compute:
- Velocity: $(p_t - p_{t-1}) / \Delta t$
- Acceleration: $(v_t - v_{t-1}) / \Delta t$
- Trajectory trend: Is target approaching or receding?
- Dropout handling: If $p_t$ is invalid, use $p_{t-1}$

**Limitation**: Only 0.04 seconds of history (4 frames @ 100Hz). Cannot reason about long-term trajectory like LSTM theoretically could.

## Expected Timeline

| Time | Steps | Expected State |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 0:00 | 0 | Training starts |
| 0:15 | 250k | First successes appear |
| 1:00 | 1M | Success ~10-15% |
| 2:00 | 2M | Success ~15-20% |
| 3:00 | 3M | Success ~20-25% |
| 4:00 | 4M | Success ~25-30% |
| 5:00 | 5M | Success ~30-35% |
| 6:00 | 6M | Success ~35-40% |
| 7:00 | 7M | Converging |

**Hardware**: 16 parallel envs, GPU-accelerated
**Throughput**: ~10,000 steps/second expected

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Won't Start
```bash
# Test environment creation
python -c "from environment import InterceptEnvironment; import yaml; \
           config = yaml.safe_load(open('config.yaml')); \
           env = InterceptEnvironment(config['environment']); \
           print('Environment OK')"
```

### GPU Not Detected
```bash
# Check CUDA
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"

# Check GPU memory
nvidia-smi
```

### Out of Memory
```bash
# Reduce batch size in config.yaml
batch_size: 128  # or even 64

# Or reduce number of envs
n_envs: 8  # instead of 16
```

---

## Next Steps After This Experiment

### If MLP Succeeds (>40% stable)
1. Drop LSTM permanently
2. Tune MLP hyperparameters
3. Increase network size [1024, 1024, 512]
4. Enable curriculum progression
5. Target 60-80% success rate

### If MLP Fails Similarly
1. Task may be too hard for current RL
2. Try omniscient baseline (full state)
3. Implement proportional navigation baseline
4. Consider SAC, privileged learning, or HER

### If MLP Partially Works (30-40% stable)
1. MLP confirms LSTM was unstable
2. Try Transformer for longer context
3. Try attention mechanism
4. Try frame-stack=8 (more temporal context)

# Unity RL Inference API Feasibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the feasibility of creating an inference API system that connects trained Phase 4 RL policies to Unity simulation environments for real-time missile control. Based on comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase, this integration is **highly feasible** with robust infrastructure already in place.

**Key Finding**: The existing `bridge_server.py` provides a production-ready HTTP/JSON API framework that can be directly extended for Unity integration, significantly reducing implementation complexity.

## Current System Architecture Analysis

### Core Inference Infrastructure

#### Existing Bridge Server (`bridge_server.py`)
- **Production-ready Flask API** with CORS support for Unity integration
- **Model loading & inference pipeline** supporting PPO policies with VecNormalize
- **JSON request/response protocol** optimized for real-time inference
- **Performance monitoring** with request tracking and timing metrics
- **Error handling** with comprehensive validation and graceful degradation

#### Policy Architecture (`run_inference.py`, `radar_env.py`)
- **Multi-scenario evaluation** with configurable environments
- **Deterministic inference mode** for consistent policy execution
- **6DOF state representation** compatible with Unity's coordinate systems
- **Action space**: 6-dimensional control (angular rates + thrust)
- **Observation space**: Radar-only observations (34-dimensional for single interceptor)

#### Data Pipeline (`episode_logger.py`)
- **Unity-compatible logging format** with ENU coordinate frame
- **6DOF state tracking** (position, quaternion, velocity, angular velocity)
- **JSONL episode format** for replay and analysis
- **Real-time state broadcasting** capability

### Unity Integration Readiness

#### Coordinate System Compatibility
- **ENU Right-Handed**: Phase 4 uses standard ENU coordinates
- **Unity Left-Handed**: Requires coordinate transformation matrix
- **Quaternion Format**: Both systems use [w,x,y,z] quaternion format
- **Units**: Consistent meters/seconds/radians across both systems

#### Control Interface Mapping
```
RL Policy Output → Unity Input
action[0] → body_rate_command.pitch (rad/s)
action[1] → body_rate_command.yaw (rad/s)  
action[2] → body_rate_command.roll (rad/s)
action[3] → thrust_command (0-1 normalized)
action[4] → reserved/auxiliary
action[5] → reserved/auxiliary
```

    # Transform to RL observation space
    rl_observation = transform_unity_to_rl_observation(unity_state)
    
    # Get policy action
    action = model.predict(rl_observation, deterministic=True)
    
    # Transform to Unity control format

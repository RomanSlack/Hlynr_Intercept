# Easy scenario - basic single missile interception

name: easy
description: Simple scenario for initial training and testing
difficulty: 1

environment:
  # Easy scenario - realistic BMD geometry but closer and slower
  target_position: [0, 0, 0]  # Defended target at origin

  # Interceptor launches from defended target
  interceptor_spawn:
    position: [[0, 0, 0], [30, 30, 10]]  # Launch from target area
    velocity: [[30, 30, 50], [50, 50, 90]]  # Moderate launch (still easier than standard)

  # Incoming threat - close and slow for easier learning
  missile_spawn:
    position: [[1000, 1000, 1200], [2000, 2000, 2000]]  # 1.5-3km away
    velocity: [[-60, -60, -30], [-90, -90, -50]]  # Slow descent toward origin

  # Extended episode length for learning
  max_steps: 2000  # 20 seconds

  # Reduced physics difficulty

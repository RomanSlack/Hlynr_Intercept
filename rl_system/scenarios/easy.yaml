# Easy scenario - basic single missile interception

name: easy
description: Simple scenario for initial training and testing
difficulty: 1

environment:
  # Spawn configuration - improved geometry for easier initial learning
  # Interceptor behind missile in pursuit configuration
  missile_spawn:
    position: [[400, 400, 350], [500, 500, 450]]  # Ahead of interceptor
    velocity: [[80, 80, -30], [120, 120, -40]]

  interceptor_spawn:
    position: [[100, 100, 100], [200, 200, 150]]  # Behind missile
    velocity: [[60, 60, 15], [90, 90, 25]]  # Moving toward missile

  target_position: [1000, 1000, 5]  # Further target for more time

  # Extended episode length for learning
  max_steps: 2000  # 20 seconds

  # Reduced physics difficulty
  wind:
    velocity: [2.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    variability: 0.05

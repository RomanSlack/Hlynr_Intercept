# Hard scenario - challenging interception

name: hard
description: Difficult scenario with aggressive missiles and poor conditions
difficulty: 3

environment:
  # Wide spawn variation with pursuit geometry
  missile_spawn:
    position: [[400, 400, 300], [700, 700, 550]]  # Wide variation
    velocity: [[120, 120, -40], [180, 180, -60]]  # Fast missiles

  interceptor_spawn:
    position: [[100, 100, 80], [350, 350, 200]]  # Must catch up
    velocity: [[40, 40, 10], [100, 100, 30]]  # Variable initial speed

  target_position: [1300, 1300, 5]  # Further target for challenge

  # Extended episode length
  max_steps: 2000  # 20 seconds
  
  # Strong variable wind
  wind:
    velocity: [15.0, 8.0, -2.0]
    variability: 0.25

# Hard scenario - challenging interception

name: hard
description: Difficult scenario with aggressive missiles and poor conditions
difficulty: 3

environment:
  # Hard scenario - realistic BMD geometry with challenging conditions
  target_position: [0, 0, 0]  # Defended target at origin

  # Interceptor launches from defended target
  interceptor_spawn:
    position: [[0, 0, 0], [70, 70, 15]]  # Launch from target area (wider variation)
    velocity: [[10, 10, 30], [35, 35, 70]]  # Slow launch (challenging)

  # Incoming threat - far distance, high speed, high altitude
  missile_spawn:
    position: [[4500, 4500, 4500], [7000, 7000, 7000]]  # 6-10km away, very high altitude
    velocity: [[-160, -160, -85], [-240, -240, -120]]  # Fast aggressive descent toward origin

  # Extended episode length
  max_steps: 2000  # 20 seconds
  
  # Strong variable wind
  wind:
    velocity: [15.0, 8.0, -2.0]
    variability: 0.25
  
  # Poor radar for hard scenario
  radar_range: 3500.0  # Short range
  radar_noise: 0.15  # High noise
  radar_quality: 0.75  # Degraded quality
  radar_beam_width: 45.0  # Narrow beam
  min_detection_range: 75.0  # Poor close tracking
  
  # Aggressive evasion
  missile_evasion: true

name: hard
description: Difficult scenario with aggressive missiles and poor conditions
difficulty: 3

environment:
  # Hard scenario - challenging high-altitude intercepts with fast missiles
  missile_spawn:
    position: [[350, 350, 1000], [700, 700, 1500]]  # Very high, wide variation
    velocity: [[90, 90, -55], [140, 140, -80]]  # Fast ballistic descent

  interceptor_spawn:
    position: [[150, 150, 200], [400, 400, 500]]  # Wide spawn variation
    velocity: [[70, 70, 35], [130, 130, 70]]  # Must accelerate aggressively

  target_position: [1200, 1200, 5]  # Distant target

  # Extended episode length
  max_steps: 2000  # 20 seconds
  
  # Strong variable wind

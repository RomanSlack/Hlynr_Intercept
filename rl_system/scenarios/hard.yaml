# Hard scenario - challenging interception

name: hard
description: Difficult scenario with aggressive missiles and poor conditions
difficulty: 3

environment:
  # Hard scenario - realistic BMD geometry with challenging conditions
  target_position: [0, 0, 0]  # Defended target at origin

  # Interceptor launches from defended target
  interceptor_spawn:
    position: [[0, 0, 0], [70, 70, 15]]  # Launch from target area (wider variation)
    velocity: [[10, 10, 30], [35, 35, 70]]  # Slow launch (challenging)

  # Incoming threat - far distance, high speed
  missile_spawn:
    position: [[2500, 2500, 2500], [4000, 4000, 4000]]  # 3.5-5.5km away
    velocity: [[-140, -140, -75], [-200, -200, -100]]  # Fast aggressive descent toward origin

  # Extended episode length
  max_steps: 2000  # 20 seconds
  
  # Strong variable wind
  wind:
    velocity: [15.0, 8.0, -2.0]
    variability: 0.25

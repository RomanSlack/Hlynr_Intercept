# Training Run Summary - Value Convergence Test

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Duration**: ~2 hours (15M steps)
**Objective**: Test if vf_coef=1.0 + success tracking breaks 33% plateau

## Changes Applied vs Previous 33% Run

### 1. ✅ Success Rate Tracking (FIXED)
- **Previous**: No tracking - trained blind
- **Now**: Real-time tracking in TensorBoard
- **Metrics available**:
  - `episode/intercepted` - Binary 0/1 per episode
  - `episode/success_rate_pct` - Rolling 100-episode average
  - `episode/reward` - Episode cumulative reward

### 2. ✅ Value Function Learning (DOUBLED)
- **Previous**: `vf_coef: 0.5`
- **Now**: `vf_coef: 1.0`
- **Impact**: 2x gradient updates for value function
- **Goal**: Drive value_loss from 9,030 → <100

### 3. Configuration Summary
```yaml
total_timesteps: 15000000
vf_coef: 1.0  # ← DOUBLED
learning_rate: 0.0003
net_arch: [128, 128]
n_envs: 16
batch_size: 512
n_steps: 2048
```

## Training Command
```bash
cd /home/roman/Hlynr_Intercept/rl_system
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

## What to Monitor During Training

### TensorBoard (run in separate terminal)
```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:6006

**Critical Metrics to Watch**:

1. **episode/success_rate_pct** (NEW!)
   - Baseline: Should start ~33% (from random init)
   - Target progression:
     - 5M steps: >40%
     - 10M steps: >55%
     - 15M steps: >70%
   - **If stuck at 33%**: Value function still not converging

2. **train/value_loss**
   - Baseline: Started at 9,030 (previous run)
   - Target progression:
     - 2M steps: <5,000 (47% improvement)
     - 5M steps: <1,000 (89% improvement)
     - 10M steps: <500 (94% improvement)
     - 15M steps: <100 (99% improvement - GOAL!)
   - **If not decreasing**: May need vf_coef=2.0

3. **rollout/ep_rew_mean**
   - Baseline: ~33,000 (good)
   - Should remain stable or increase slightly
   - **If decreasing**: Policy degrading, reduce vf_coef

4. **train/explained_variance**
   - Target: >0.95 (indicates value function quality)
   - Should remain high and stable

## Expected Outcomes

### ✅ Best Case (Target)
- Success rate: 33% → 75-85%
- Value loss: 9,030 → <100
- Less bimodal behavior (more "close misses")
- Model learns to course-correct mid-flight

### ⚠️ Partial Success
- Success rate: 33% → 50-60%
- Value loss: 9,030 → 500-1,000
- **Action**: Extend to 20M steps OR increase vf_coef to 1.5

### ❌ No Improvement
- Success rate: Still ~33%
- Value loss: Still >5,000
- **Action**: Increase vf_coef to 2.0 OR use separate networks:
  ```python
  net_arch=dict(pi=[128,128], vf=[256,256])
  ```

## After Training Completes

### 1. Check TensorBoard Metrics
```bash
# Final success rate
grep "success_rate_pct" logs/training_*/metrics.jsonl | tail -5

# Final value loss
# Check in TensorBoard: train/value_loss at step 15M
```

### 2. Run Inference Test (100 episodes)
```bash
# Use best model from training
cd /home/roman/Hlynr_Intercept/rl_system
# Find the best model path from checkpoints/training_*/best/
python inference.py --model <path_to_best_model> --num_episodes 100
```

### 3. Compare Results
| Metric | Previous (33%) | Target | Actual |
|--------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Success Rate | 33% | >70% | ___ |
| Value Loss | 9,030 | <100 | ___ |
| Avg Steps (success) | 908 | <1000 | ___ |
| Avg Steps (failure) | 1585 | <1500 | ___ |
| Bimodal Gaps | 200-1400m empty | Some close misses | ___ |

## Troubleshooting

### If success rate doesn't improve:
1. Check value_loss is decreasing
2. If value_loss still high: Increase vf_coef to 2.0
3. If value_loss low but success rate stuck: Curriculum too aggressive
4. Check episode/intercepted for any successful episodes

### If training crashes:
1. Check GPU memory (may need to reduce n_envs)
2. Check logs for NaN errors
3. Verify environment working: `python -c "from environment import InterceptEnvironment; print('OK')"`

## Key Differences from Previous Runs

| Run | Steps | vf_coef | Success Tracking | Success Rate | Value Loss |
|-----|-------|---------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| 7M (Oct 21 10am) | 7M | 0.5 | ❌ No | 33% | Unknown |
| 15M (Oct 21 12pm) | 15M | 0.5 | ❌ No | 33% | 9,030 |
| **THIS RUN** | **15M** | **1.0** | **✅ Yes** | **?** | **?** |

The key innovation is **visibility** - we can now watch training progress in real-time and make informed decisions!

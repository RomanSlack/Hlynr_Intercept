# Compatibility config for OLD 17D models (pre-ground-radar)
# Use this config to run inference with models trained before ground radar was added

# This file inherits from config.yaml but DISABLES ground radar
# to maintain 17D observation space compatibility

# Import base config (Python will need to merge this)
# For now, copy relevant sections and set ground_radar.enabled = false

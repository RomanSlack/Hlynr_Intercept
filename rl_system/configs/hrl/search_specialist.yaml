# Search Specialist Pre-Training Configuration
# Specialist for wide-area scanning and target acquisition
# OBJECTIVE: Rapidly acquire radar lock on target

# Inherit base settings
parent_config: ../../config.yaml

# Specialist-specific training
training:
  total_timesteps: 500000  # 500k steps for proper learning
  n_envs: 8  # More parallel environments for faster training
  n_steps: 2048  # Longer rollouts for better gradient estimates
  batch_size: 256

  # Learning parameters
  learning_rate: 0.0003
  gamma: 0.99
  gae_lambda: 0.97  # Higher for longer-horizon credit assignment

  # Entropy for exploration (search needs more exploration)
  ent_coef: 0.02
  ent_coef_final: 0.005  # Decay entropy over training
  ent_decay_steps: 400000

  # Network architecture

# Environment modifications for search training
environment:
  max_steps: 1000  # Give enough time to acquire lock

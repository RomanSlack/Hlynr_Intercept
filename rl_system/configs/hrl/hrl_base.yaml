# HRL Base Configuration (Phase 1: Stub/Scaffolding)
# This config enables the HRL system with no-op specialists

# Inherit base settings from parent config
parent_config: ../../config.yaml

# HRL-specific settings
hrl:
  enabled: true  # Enable HRL for this config

  # Hierarchy settings
  decision_interval_steps: 100  # High-level decides every 100 steps (1Hz @ 100Hz)
  default_option: 0  # Start with SEARCH
  enable_forced_transitions: true  # Allow physics-based option switching

  # Forced transition thresholds
  thresholds:
    radar_lock_quality_min: 0.3      # Below this, lose track → SEARCH
    radar_lock_quality_search: 0.7   # Above this, exit search → TRACK
    close_range_threshold: 100.0     # meters - trigger TERMINAL
    terminal_fuel_min: 0.1           # Min fuel to enter terminal
    miss_imminent_distance: 200.0    # If distance increasing beyond this

# Training overrides for HRL
training:
  total_timesteps: 100000  # Short smoke test
  n_envs: 1  # Single environment for Phase 1 smoke test
  n_steps: 512  # Shorter rollouts for smoke test

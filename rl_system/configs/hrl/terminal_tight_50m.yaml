# Terminal Specialist Training - Fixed 50m Intercept Radius
#
# APPROACH: Instead of curriculum (which causes threshold clustering),
# train with a FIXED tight radius from the start.
#
# The model must learn to get within 50m to succeed - no easy 100m threshold.
# This is harder but produces a model that actually achieves precision.

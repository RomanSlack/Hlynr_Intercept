## Core Components

### 1. Curriculum Manager (`aegis_intercept/curriculum/curriculum_manager.py`)

The curriculum system orchestrates progressive learning through 5 distinct phases:

#### Phase Definitions
```python
# Lines 32-38
class CurriculumPhase(Enum):
    PHASE_1_BASIC_3DOF = "phase_1_basic_3dof"
    PHASE_2_ADVANCED_3DOF = "phase_2_advanced_3dof" 
    PHASE_3_SIMPLIFIED_6DOF = "phase_3_simplified_6dof"
    PHASE_4_FULL_6DOF = "phase_4_full_6dof"
    PHASE_5_EXPERT_6DOF = "phase_5_expert_6dof"
```

#### Phase Configuration
Each phase has specific parameters defined in `_initialize_default_phases()` (lines 251-322):

- **Phase 1**: Basic 3DOF with simplified physics, 70% success threshold
- **Phase 2**: Advanced 3DOF with wind effects, 75% success threshold
- **Phase 3**: Simplified 6DOF with attitude control, 65% success threshold
- **Phase 4**: Full 6DOF with complete physics, 70% success threshold
- **Phase 5**: Expert 6DOF with extreme scenarios, 80% success threshold

#### Advancement Logic
The system monitors performance metrics (lines 452-481) and automatically advances when:
- Minimum episode requirements are met
- Success rate thresholds are achieved
- Additional criteria (fuel efficiency, time) are satisfied

### 2. 6DOF Environment (`aegis_intercept/envs/aegis_6dof_env.py`)

The core simulation environment supporting both 3DOF and 6DOF modes.

#### State Space Design
- **3DOF Mode**: 14-dimensional observation space (backward compatibility)
- **6DOF Mode**: 31-dimensional observation space
  - Interceptor: position(3) + velocity(3) + quaternion(4) + angular_velocity(3) = 13D
  - Missile: position(3) + velocity(3) + quaternion(4) + angular_velocity(3) = 13D
  - Environment: time(1) + fuel(1) + wind(3) = 5D

#### Action Space Modes
```python
# Lines 46-50
class ActionMode(Enum):
    ACCELERATION_3DOF = "accel_3dof"     # [ax, ay, az, explode] - 4D
    ACCELERATION_6DOF = "accel_6dof"     # [fx, fy, fz, tx, ty, tz, explode] - 7D
    THRUST_ATTITUDE = "thrust_attitude"   # [thrust_mag, pitch, yaw, roll, explode] - 5D
```

#### Physics Integration
The environment integrates with the 6DOF physics engine (lines 465-540):
- Force and torque application
- Fuel consumption calculations
- Structural limit monitoring
- Aerodynamic effects

Sophisticated missile behavior with multiple evasion strategies:

#### Threat Assessment
- Distance-based threat evaluation
- Closing velocity analysis
- Intercept geometry calculations

#### Evasion Patterns (lines 600-634 in `aegis_6dof_env.py`)
- **Spiral**: Coordinated rolling maneuvers
- **Weave**: Lateral oscillations with altitude changes
- **Jink**: Rapid direction changes
- **Barrel Roll**: High-rate rotation maneuvers

### 5. Training Script (`scripts/train_ppo_phase3_6dof.py`)

The main training orchestrator integrating all components:

#### Enhanced Neural Network (lines 129-178)
```python
class Enhanced6DOFAgent(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, envs):
        # Larger networks for 6DOF complexity
        hidden_size = 512
        # Feature extraction, critic, and actor networks
```

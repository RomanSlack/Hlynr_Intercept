# HRL Breakthrough

## Holy Shit.

**Flat PPO:** MONTHS of grinding, 10M steps → 70% success, ~199m precision (barely hitting)

**HRL:** 65 minutes, 310k steps → 100% success, 0.4m precision (DIRECT HITS)

**The Numbers:** 32x faster, 500x more precise, FIRST TRY.

## What Actually Happened

We broke the problem into Search→Track→Terminal specialists. Each trained for 15 minutes on their piece.

The result? The system learned sub-meter accuracy WITHOUT BEING TOLD TO. The terminal specialist just... figured out extreme precision because the rewards made it worthwhile.

This isn't incremental improvement. This is watching AI discover something we didn't program.

## Why This Feels Different

After months of tweaking PPO hyperparameters, reward functions, network architectures... getting 70% felt like climbing Everest.

Then one architectural change. One run. 65 minutes.

100% success. Half-meter precision.

It worked better than it had any right to.

## The Moment of Doubt

Spent hours today finding bugs, questioning everything, almost convinced it was fake.

The precision held. The efficiency held. The emergent behavior held.

It's real.

Every failed PPO run was a step. Every 40% training crash was a step.

Today, those steps became flight.
